## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using Power BI. It focuses on understanding customer behavior, identifying key factors influencing churn, and providing actionable insights to reduce churn rates. The analysis is supported by interactive dashboards and visualizations, demonstrating proficiency in Power BI and data storytelling.

---

## Key Objectives
- **Analyze Customer Churn**: Identify trends and patterns in customer churn behavior.
- **Understand Factors**: Explore demographics, contracts, payment methods, and data plans to determine their impact on churn.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide recommendations to reduce churn rates.

---

## Tools and Skills
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and data visualization.
- **DAX**: For custom calculations and insights.
- **Data Analysis**: Identifying trends and patterns in churn behavior.

---

## Key Insights
1. **Overall Churn Rate**: The churn rate is 26.86%.
2. **Demographics**: Younger customers and those with lower tenure are more likely to churn.
3. **Contracts**: Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate (46.29%), while yearly contracts have the lowest (6.62%).
4. **Payment Methods**: Customers using paper checks have higher churn rates compared to direct debit and credit card users.
5. **Data Plans**: Customers without unlimited data plans are more likely to churn.
6. **Churn Reasons**: Key reasons include high prices, poor service quality, and competitor offers.

## Dataset Details
This analysis uses a sample dataset that includes:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, and location.
- **Contract Information**: Type of contract, payment method, tenure.
- **Churn Label**: Indicates whether the customer churned (1) or not (0).

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Add predictive modeling using machine learning to forecast churn.
- Enhance the Power BI dashboard with more interactivity (e.g., drill-through pages).
- Use additional datasets for deeper insights.
